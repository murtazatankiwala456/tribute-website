      <h1>Achievements</h1>
      <p>
        After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam
        joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence
        Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau,
        Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the
        Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by
        designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of
        a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram
        Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and
        recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba
        Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was
        transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he
        was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle
        (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth
        orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket
        project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the
        government's approval and expanded the programme to include more
        engineers.[25]
